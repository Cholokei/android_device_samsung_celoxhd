Device folder for Celox HD
==========================

Follow the usual instructions to download sources for CM9, e.g.

  mkdir ~/android/system
  cd ~/android/system
  curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo
  chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
  repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b ics


Include the following in .repo/local_manifest.xml to grab these additional repositories:

  <project name="CyanogenMod/android_kernel_samsung_msm8660-common" path="kernel/samsung/msm8660-common" remote="github" revision="ics" />
  <project name="CyanogenMod/android_device_samsung_msm8660-common" path="device/samsung/msm8660-common" remote="github" revision="ics" />


Download or update all repositories:

  repo sync -j4


To build the kernel, you need to download the kernel defconfig found in my Github, or include it in your local_manifest.xml:

  <project name="dsixda/android_kernel_samsung_celoxhd" path="kernel/samsung/msm8660-common/arch/arm/configs" revision="master" />


Get all the prebuilts, like Rom Manager:

  vendor/cm/get-prebuilts


NOTE 1: For now, when building CM9, set OPTIONS.modelidcfg = False in build/tools/releasetools/ota_from_target_files.  This will prevent errors with the missing /system/bin/modelid_cfg.sh when flashing with updater-script.

NOTE 2: If building ClockworkMod, to avoid the Nandroid backup process hanging on long file names, open /bootable/recovery/nandroid.c and add the command "return;" to the first line of the 'yaffs_callback' procedure.


Ready to build!
  . build/envsetup.sh
  brunch cm_celoxhd-eng


OPTIONAL: If you want to build ClockworkMod:

  . build/tools/device/makerecoveries.sh cm_celoxhd-eng  <-- OPTIONAL, for ClockworkMod only
