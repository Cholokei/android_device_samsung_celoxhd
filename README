NOTE 1: For now, when building, set OPTIONS.modelidcfg = False in build/tools/releasetools/ota_from_target_files.  This will prevent errors with the missing /system/bin/modelid_cfg.sh when flashing with updater-script.

NOTE 2: For ClockworkMod, to avoid the Nandroid backup process hanging on long file names, open /bootable/recovery/nandroid.c and add the command "return;" to the first line of the 'yaffs_callback' procedure.
